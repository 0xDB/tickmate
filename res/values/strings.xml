    <string name="about_description">Tickmate is basically a one bit journal. For each day, you can specify 
        whether something has occurred or not. The occurrences can be arbitrary things, like flossing your 
        teeth or having a drink. You are able to quantify your habits and the accumulated data can be 
        displayed for the past weeks or months to track changes over time. This way, it may help you to 
        get over your old habits or embody new ones.
